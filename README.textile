h1. Ruxtape: A Ruby Mixtape

Ruxtape is a ruby-based mixtape that allows you to share personal playlists with your friends or family.  You can create playlists for your friends, sharing with them is easy, as they just need to have the link and a flash player in their brower.  It is *not* intended as a way to share music, nor pirate any copyrighted material.  Make sure that you have the copyright owner's permission before sharing your Ruxtape.  It was inspired by "opentape":http://opentape.fm.

h2. Requirements

We've included all the libraries that you should need along with Ruxtape, so you should not have to monkey around with anything except the following items, listed below:

* RubyGems >= 1.1

h2. Installing



h2. Deploying

Ruxtape has a sample rack adapter included to make deployment quite simple.  Of course, it comes with it's own Camping Server so you can simply type @./camping .@ from the root directory and Ruxtape will be available on port 3000.  You can also copy @examples/example.config.ru@ to the root directory and use anything that Rack supports.  The included rack config file words wonderfully with Phusion Passenger.  Deployment should be as simple as copying the Rack config file from
